# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the clipboard history user interface to address usability issues including single-line item display requiring scrolling, non-functional clear history button, lack of individual item deletion, and poor hover visibility.

## Glossary

- **Clipboard_Manager**: The Go application that manages clipboard history and displays the UI
- **History_Item**: A single clipboard entry stored in the history list
- **History_List**: The scrollable list widget displaying all clipboard history items
- **Delete_Button**: Individual X icon button for removing specific history items
- **Clear_Button**: Button that removes all history items at once
- **Hover_State**: Visual feedback when user moves cursor over interactive elements

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clipboard history items displayed with proper text wrapping, so that I can read the full content without horizontal scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a History_Item contains text longer than the display width, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL wrap the text to multiple lines
2. THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL display each History_Item with a maximum height limit to prevent excessive vertical space usage
3. WHEN text exceeds the maximum display length, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL show a truncation indicator
4. THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL preserve the original text formatting when copying items to clipboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the clear history button to work properly, so that I can remove all clipboard items when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the Clear_Button, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL remove all History_Items from storage
2. WHEN the clear operation completes, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL update the History_List to show empty state
3. WHEN the clear operation completes, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL save the empty history to persistent storage
4. THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL provide visual feedback during the clear operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete individual clipboard items, so that I can remove specific entries without clearing the entire history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL display a Delete_Button for each History_Item
2. WHEN the user clicks a Delete_Button, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL remove only that specific History_Item
3. WHEN an item is deleted, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL update the History_List immediately
4. WHEN an item is deleted, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL save the updated history to persistent storage
5. THE Delete_Button SHALL be visually distinct and easily clickable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want better visual feedback when hovering over items, so that I can clearly see which item I'm about to select.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over a History_Item, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL apply a visible highlight color
2. THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL ensure hover highlight maintains sufficient contrast for text readability
3. WHEN the user hovers over a Delete_Button, THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL provide distinct visual feedback
4. THE Clipboard_Manager SHALL use consistent hover styling across all interactive elements
